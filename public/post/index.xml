      <description>Together with a couple of friends, we’ve created our own personal Awesome Mix Vol.1Instead of being a tape with 13 songs however, we’ve added roughly 1.500 songs. Now I’m curious as to how our musical taste differs from one another, but also what kind of musical clusters we have created in our playlist.
Let’s get started.## Rspotify spotifyr tidyverse knitr kableExtra ggthemes ## TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## highcharter htmltools widgetframe cluster factoextra here ## TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUEFirst, I’ll have to extract the audio features of each song in the playlist.</description>

      <description>IntroductionI love traveling, and I love world maps, even more so when I can hang them on my walls. Now that got me thinking. What if I could create maps, with a similar look and feel, of all my holiday destinations? And what if I plot my location progression on top of the destination? That would be absolutely awesome!
In a recent post, I described how Google often tracks your location (if you agreed to it), and plotted each of my tracked location on a map.</description>

I started scouring packages and functions to find what I needed. In this post, you’ll find some tips and tricks that helped me speed things up.</description>
