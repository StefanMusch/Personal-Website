# Introduction

I love traveling, and I love world maps, even more so when I can hang them on my walls. Now that got me thinking. What if I could create maps, with a similar look and feel, of all my holiday destinations? And what if I plot my location progression on top of the destination? That would be absolutely awesome! 

In a [recent post](https://stefanmusch.netlify.com/2017/06/my-tracked-locations/), I described how Google often tracks your location (if you agreed to it), and plotted each of my tracked location on a map. Now, I could easily subset that data on the time that I went on holiday, and plot that data on a map.

However, I noticed that after 2016, when I changed phones, I was no longer tracking my own GPS data.. **(never thought I would be sad about a company not having tracked my complete whereabouts for over a year.)** Anyway, I had to get creative and find a workaround. Now I knew that Google has a fantastic API, which solves all my problems! 

Let's get started with my most recent holiday - Scotland - which is an absolutely stunning holiday destination. Especially around the [Isle of Skye](https://www.google.nl/search?q=isle+of+skye&rlz=1C1GCEA_enNL771NL771&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiM_rDnubTZAhXDyKQKHfT-DWIQ_AUICygC&biw=1920&bih=987). The end product will look like this:

</center>

# Background Map
```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = T, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,
                      fig.height = 6, fig.width= 6, fig.align= 'center')
```

```{r echo = T, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
## Load packages & Install if necessary
ipak <- function(pkg) {
  new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
  if (length(new.pkg))
  install.packages(new.pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
  sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)
}


packages <- c("ggplot2", "ggmap", "ggthemes", "tidyverse")
ipak(packages)

```

Firstly I had to find a background map which suited my style. In my opinion [Stamen](http://maps.stamen.com/#watercolor/12/37.7706/-122.3782) has the most beautiful maps with the `Toner` and `Watercolor` versions. Play around with the `get_map` options to find the right zoom level, maptype and color that you wish your background map to have. My setup gave me the following output:

```{r}
toner_map <- get_map(c(-4.18265, 56.816922), #Insert the desired centre coordinates of your map
                     zoom = 7,
                     source='stamen',
                     maptype="toner-background", 
                     color = "bw", 
                     crop = TRUE)

ggmap(toner_map) +
  theme_map()
```

Now, I thought this background was a little too black, so I decided to create the inverse of the map.

```{r}

## Inverted toner map
# invert colors in raster
invert <- function(x) rgb(t(255-col2rgb(x))/255)    
toner_map_inv <- as.raster(apply(toner_map, 2, invert))

# copy attributes from original object
class(toner_map_inv) <- class(toner_map)
attr(toner_map_inv, "bb") <- attr(toner_map, "bb")

ggmap(toner_map_inv)+
  theme_map()

```

Looking sharp already! Now the next step is to plot my visited locations and trace my whereabouts step-wise.

# Location Coordinates

* Step 1. Create a vector of the exact route with the full names, and often, the country.
    + Google's API sometimes gets confused when there are multiple cities with the same name. The API is not limited to cities. As you can see, I included **Old Man of Storr UK, which is a Point of Interest, and not a city, which also works! 
    
```{r}

# cities to geolocate
city_name <- c("Newcastle UK", "St. Abbs UK", "Edinburgh", "Ballachulish UK", "Glencoe UK", "Fort William UK","Ben Nevis UK", "Kyle of Lochalsh UK", "Broadford UK", "Portree UK" , "Old Man of Storr UK", "Portree UK", "Fort Augustus UK", "Dalwhinnie UK", "Perth UK", "Edinburgh", "Melrose UK", "Newcastle UK") 

# initialize dataframe  
 cities <- tibble(    
  city = city_name,    
  lon = rep(NA, length(city_name)),    
  lat = rep(NA, length(city_name))  
)
```

* Step 2. Use the function `geocode` to loop over the vector, and find the coordinates for each location
    + I used a nested **while** loop because of the rate limit on Google's API, ensuring that all locations were geolocated.
    
```{r}
# loop cities through API to overcome API request limit
for(c in city_name){
  temp <- tibble(lon = NA)
  # geolocate until found
  while(is.na(temp$lon)) {
    temp <- geocode(c)
  } 
  # write to dataframe
  cities[cities$city == c, -1] <- temp
}

head(cities, n = 3)
```

* Step 3. We need a data frame where each route is tracked from the initial point to the next. i.e. from Newcastle to St. Abbs, from St. Abbs to Edinburgh and so on. First

```{r}
# 
cities_trek <- cities %>%
  mutate(from = lag(city),
         to = city ) %>%
  select(from, to) %>%
  filter(from != "NA")

head(cities_trek, n = 3)
```


* Step 4. For each `from` and `to` combination, the `trek()` function returns a bunch of coordinates based on the parameters **mode**, **structure** and **output**. If for example, you want to visualize a walking route, you can change the **mode**. 

```{r}

# create a dataframe of each route, store in a list
treklist <- list()
for (i in 1:nrow(cities_trek)){
  trek_df <- trek(from = cities_trek$from[i], to = cities_trek$to[i], structure = "route", mode = "driving", output = "simple")
  treklist[[i]] <- trek_df
}

# bind all rows of each dataframe in the list to a new dataframe. 
tracks <- do.call(rbind, treklist)

head(tracks, n = 10)
```

* Step 5. Plotting time!

# Creating your own beautiful poster!

* Use `geom_points()` to add markers for your cities dataframe. Add **colors**, **alpha values** and **size** to your own style. I liked the red contrast. I added multiple to create some sort of signal.
* Use `geom_path()` for your tracks dataframe, again, give it your own spin!

```{r}

scot_map <- ggmap(toner_map_inv) +
  geom_point(data=cities, aes(lon, lat),
             alpha = 1, color = "DarkRed", size = 2)+
  geom_point(data=cities, aes(lon, lat), 
             alpha = 0.7, color = "DarkRed", size = 2.5)+
  geom_point(data=cities, aes(lon, lat), 
             alpha = 0.4, color = "DarkRed", size = 4.5)+
  geom_path(data=tracks, aes(lon,lat), color="red", 
            size=0.6, alpha = 0.5, linetype = "dotted" )+
  labs(caption = "Scotland '17")+
  guides(alpha = FALSE, 
         size = FALSE)+
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1,3))+
  theme_map()+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust=0.5, size=rel(1.5), vjust = -0.5),
        panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill=NA, size=2))

scot_map
#Use the function below if you want to save the image.
#  ggsave(filename = "Images/scotland_map.png", plot = scot_map,
#         width = 6.7, height = 7, units = 'cm',
#         scale = 2, dpi = 600)
```

Now all that is left to do is, find a frame, print the image and put it on your wall!


# Bonus! Can't choose the background map? Neither could I. 

Which is why I created the script below, where you can specify your map choices in a list, and see them all together! Or save them all together.

```{r, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 10}

# Regular Toner
toner_map <- get_map(c(-4.18265, 56.816922), 
                     zoom = 7,
                     source='stamen',
                     maptype="toner-background", 
                     color = "bw", crop = TRUE)

## Inverted toner map

invert <- function(x) rgb(t(255-col2rgb(x))/255)    
toner_map_inv <- as.raster(apply(toner_map, 2, invert))

# copy attributes from original object
class(toner_map_inv) <- class(toner_map)
attr(toner_map_inv, "bb") <- attr(toner_map, "bb")

#Terrain map
terrain_map <- get_map(c(-4.18265, 56.816922), zoom = 7,
                       source='stamen',
                       maptype="terrain", 
                       color = "color", 
                       crop = TRUE)

#Terrain map BG
terrain_map_bg <- get_map(c(-4.18265, 56.816922), 
                        zoom = 7,
                       source='stamen',
                       maptype="terrain-background", 
                       color = "color", crop = TRUE)

#watercolor
watercolor <- get_map(c(-4.18265, 56.816922), 
                        zoom = 7,
                       source='stamen',
                       maptype="watercolor", 
                       color = "color", crop = TRUE)

#inverted watercolor
invert <- function(x) rgb(t(255-col2rgb(x))/255)    
watercolor_inverted <- as.raster(apply(watercolor, 2, invert))

# copy attributes from original object
class(watercolor_inverted) <- class(watercolor)
attr(watercolor_inverted, "bb") <- attr(watercolor, "bb")

#List of all the maps
maplist <- list(terrain_map, terrain_map_bg, toner_map, toner_map_inv, watercolor, watercolor_inverted)
names(maplist)  <- c("terrain_map", "terrain_bg", "toner", "toner_inv", "watercolor", "watercolor_inverted")



#For loop
p <- list()
for (i in 1: length(maplist)){
 p[[i]] <-  ggmap(maplist[[i]]) + 
  geom_point(data=cities, aes(lon, lat), alpha = 1, color = "DarkRed", size = 2)+
  geom_point(data=cities, aes(lon, lat), alpha = 0.7, color = "DarkRed", size = 2.5)+
  geom_point(data=cities, aes(lon, lat), alpha = 0.4, color = "DarkRed", size = 4.5)+
  geom_path(data=tracks, aes(lon,lat), color="red", size=0.6, alpha = 0.5, linetype = "dotted" )+
  labs(caption = "Scotland '17")+
  guides(alpha = FALSE, 
         size = FALSE)+
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(1,3))+
  ggtitle(paste(names(maplist)[i]))+
  theme_map()+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust=0.5, size=rel(1.5), vjust = -0.5),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        panel.border = element_rect(colour = "black", fill=NA, size=2))
  }

gridExtra::grid.arrange(
  p[[1]], p[[2]], p[[3]], p[[4]], p[[5]], p[[6]], ncol = 2
)
```

# Final thoughts

Hot damn that inverted Watercolor is actually really cool! Perhaps I'll use that on my wall.
I would love to see your renditions, so feel free to leave a comment here or send me an e-mail with your own creations!
